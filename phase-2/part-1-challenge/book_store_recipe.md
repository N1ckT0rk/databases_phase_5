# Book_Store Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe

_Copy this recipe template to design and implement Model and Repository classes for a database table._

## 1. Design and create the Table

n/a table created

## 2. Create Test SQL seeds

n/a seed provided

## 3. Define the class names


```python
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: books

# Model class
# (in lib/book.py)
class Book


# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.py)
class BookRepository

```

## 4. Implement the Model class

Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

```python
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: books

# Model class
# (in lib/book.py)

class Book:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = 0
        self.title = ""
        self.author_name = ""

        # Replace the attributes by your own columns.
    def __eq__()

    def __repr__()

```

*You may choose to test-drive this class, but unless it contains any more logic than the example above, it is probably not needed.*

## 5. Define the Repository Class interface

Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you'd like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

```python
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: books

# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.py)

class BookRepository():

    # Selecting all records
    # No arguments
    def all():
        # Executes the SQL query:
        # SELECT id, title, author_name FROM books;

        # Returns an array of Book objects.

        # Gets a single record by its ID
        # One argument: the id (number)
    # def find(id):
        # Executes the SQL query:
        # SELECT id, title, author_name FROM books WHERE id = $1;

        # Returns a single Book object.

        # Add more methods below for each operation you'd like to implement.

    # def create(book)
    # insert book into DB

    # def update(student)
    # 

    # def delete(student)
    # 

```

## 6. Write Test Examples

Write Python code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as Pytest tests.

```python
# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all books

def test_get_all_records(db_connection): # See conftest.py to learn what `db_connection` is.
    db_connection.seed("seeds/book_store.sql") # Seed our database with some test data
    repository = BookRepository(db_connection) # Create a new ArtistRepository

    books = repository.all() # Get all artists

    # Assert on the results
    assert books == [
        Artist(1, 'Nineteen Eighty-Four', 'George Orwell'),
        Artist(2, 'Mrs Dalloway', 'Virginia Woolf'),
        Artist(3, 'Emma', 'Jane Austen'),
        Artist(4, 'Dracula', 'Bram Stoker'),
        Artist(5, "The Age of Innocence", "Edith Wharton")
    ]



```

Encode this example as a test.


## 7. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
