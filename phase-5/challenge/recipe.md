# Single Table Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create a database table from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
# EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here, the final line).

As a food lover,
So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
I'd like to keep a list of all my recipes with their names.

As a food lover,
So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
I'd like to keep the average cooking time (in minutes) for each recipe.

As a food lover,
So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
I'd like to give a rating to each of the recipes (from 1 to 5).

```

```
Nouns:
recipe name, cooking time, rating

```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Recipes       | 
| --------------------- | 
| recipe_name, cook_time, rating| 

Name of the table (always plural): `recipes`

Column names: `recipe_name`, `cook_time`, 'rating'

## 3. Decide the column types

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

id: SERIAL
recipe_name: text
cook_time: int
rating: int
```

## 4. Write the SQL

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: recipes.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

CREATE TABLE recipes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  recipe_name text,
  cook_time int,
  rating int
);
```

## 5. Create the table

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 recipe_directory < recipes.sql
```
